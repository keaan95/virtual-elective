## Purpose of this Series

- Learn Basic Functions in R [Week 1]
- Building your First Models in ML [Week 2]
- Visualise, Improve and Optimise your Models [Week 3]
- Develop Models on New Data Top to Toe [Week 4]


## Getting Started [before the session to be completed]

R is a program available on  your computer.
RStudio is a program that allows to visualise outputs from

1. Install the Latest Base Package of R from below:

http://www.r-project.org/

2. Install Rstudio (if comfortable operating + projecting R plots at the command line - omit this step):

https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

3. Review the Introduction to R Video - Dr Skorupska

## Getting Help Once Live

1. Ask Google - Stackoverflow - lots of solutions

2. Ask R for help
?help(package="stats")

3. Package Documentation - Google

4. Google and use StackOverflow.com

## What's R?

- A free language for statistical dataset analysis
- Enormous graphical capabilities through well-supported packages
- Interpretative language so commands are typed without requiring to build complete programmes
- Well-supported and documented modular add-on packages (16,000!) - across Stats, ML and ComputerBio
- Less learning -> more doing -> more problem-solving.

## How is it different to Excel or stats programmes e.g. SPSS?

![Lots of additional packages and resources to do more computational tasks. Shift through thousands of columns of data, visualise and adapt plots more quickly. Lots more creative capacity](https://iqss.github.io/dss-workshops/R/Rintro/images/R_chain.png)

## How does R work?

![Apply our code as keyboard commands that interact with our workspace. Import data e.g. as txt or csv files that can be exported to use in other programmes. Produce plots.](https://iqss.github.io/dss-workshops/R/Rintro/images/R_works.png)

## Machine Learning

## Install Packages

```{r,echo=TRUE}
# hashtags(#) denote a comment
# install.packages("caret")
# install.packages("ggplot2")
```

Load in our packages

```{r,echo=TRUE}
# library(ggplot2)
```

## Exercise 1 - Data Structures

Most commonly data is brought into R by txt and csv files:

```{r,echo=TRUE}
# You can fetch your WORKING directory as follows
getwd()
# Change to your local directory - in my case it is as follows:
setwd("C:/Users/keaan/OneDrive - Newcastle University/HLA - Virtual Elective/Week1/")
df <- read.csv("data.csv", sep=",",header=T,row.names = 1)
```
## Whistle stop syntax

We can operate from the command line like a calculator:

```{r,echo=TRUE}
5+15
```

A *variable* is a letter or word that is assigned a value.

```{r,echo=TRUE}
x <- 10
x
y <- 5
y
```

R will automatically add variables of the same type e.g. integers.

```{r,echo=TRUE}

y+x
```

## Whistle stop Syntax

We can combine variables, in this characters to form a string:

```{r,echo=TRUE}
z <- c("ER","PR","HR")
z
```

Essentially, a series of strings make an object and our object is df [dataframe]. In other words, strings make up columns.

## Search in a String / Column

We can search for a particular value in a string by sequence number:

```{r,echo=TRUE}
z[1]
z[1:3]
z[-1]
```

We can ask if a particular value is in a string

```{r, echo=TRUE}
z=="PR"
z[z=="PR"]
```

## EXERCISE 2.1 - Data visualisation

Lets take a look at the breast data

```{r,echo=TRUE}
head(df)
df[1:5,1:5]
```

SO we have a dataframe but exactly is composed of this?

```{r,echo=TRUE}
str(df)
with(df, table(diagnosis))
```


## EXERCISE 2.2

1. How many patients are in the data?

## EXERCISE 2.2

```{r,echo=TRUE}
nrow(df)
```


## EXERCISE 2.3 - Scatterplots

Letâ€™s Plot Radius against Perimeter Means of Our Patients

## EXERCISE 2.3

- Building graphs in R is like painting a picture.
- Elements are added one layer at a time + built up in levels

```{r,echo=TRUE}
plot(df$radius_mean,df$texture_mean)
```

```{r,echo=TRUE}
plot(df$radius_mean,df$texture_mean,
col=as.factor(df$diagnosis),
xlab="Radius Means",
ylab="Texture Means",
main="Breast Cancer Patients of Radius against Texture Means")
legend("topright",legend = c("M", "B"), pch=c(1,1), col=c("red","black"))
```


## Building our First - Histograms in Base R

Let's see how our data across looks across one variable e..g perimeter mean

```{r,echo=TRUE}
hist(df$perimeter_mean)
hist(df$perimeter_mean,col="purple")
hist(df$perimeter_mean,col="purple",xlab="Perimeter Mean")
hist(df$perimeter_mean,col="purple",xlab="Perimeter Mean",main="Distribution of Perimeter")
```

## Layering Plots using Base R

- We first need to separate our variables into two strings

```{r, echo=TRUE}
hist_b <- df$perimeter_mean[df$diagnosis=="B"]
hist_m <- df$perimeter_mean[df$diagnosis=="M"]
```


## How does this compare across both groups?

- Plot them over each other to create separation [don't copy this!]

```{r,echo=TRUE}

# First distribution
plot.new()
hist(hist_b, breaks=10, xlim=c(0,250), col=rgb(0,0,1,0.5), xlab="Perimeter Mean", 
     ylab="Density", main="Perimeter Mean across Breast Tissue Types" )

# Second with add=T to plot on top
hist(hist_m, breaks=10, xlim=c(0,250), col=rgb(1,0,0,0.5), add=T)

# Add legend
legend("topright", legend=c("Benign","Malignant"), col=c(rgb(0,0,1,0.5), 
                                                         rgb(1,0,0,0.5)), pt.cex=2, pch=15 )

```

## How can we simplify plot making?

- Packages!

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library("ggplot2")
```


## Problems for Next Week!

- How can we distinguish between our variables to see which ones help to separate our two groups?
- What plots would you like to build to help us choose variables for our models?


## Next Week

- Further reading - caret (machine learning package) - http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2017-11-17-caret_tutorial/, ggplot2 (graphical images package) - http://r-statistics.co/Complete-Ggplot2-Tutorial-Part1-With-R-Code.html,
