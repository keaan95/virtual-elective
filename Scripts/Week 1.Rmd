## Purpose of this Series

- Get you to Speed in R [Week 1]
- Building your First Models in ML [Week 2]
- Visualise, Improve and Optimise your Models [Week 3]
- Evaluate how well your Models Compare to Each other [Week 4]
- Take This Further on Your Own Datasets

## What's R?

- A free language for statistical dataset analysis
- Enormous graphical capabilities through well-supported packages
- Interpretative language so commands are typed without requiring to build complete programmes
- Well-supported and documented modular add-on packages (16,000!) - across Stats, ML and ComputerBio
- Less learning -> more doing -> more problem-solving.

## How is it different to Excel or stats programmes e.g. SPSS?

![Lots of additional packages and resources to do more computational tasks. Shift through thousands of columns of data, visualise and adapt plots more quickly. Lots more creative capacity](https://iqss.github.io/dss-workshops/R/Rintro/images/R_chain.png)

## How does R work?

![Apply our code as keyboard commands that interact with our workspace. Import data e.g. as txt or csv files that can be exported to use in other programmes. Produce plots.](https://iqss.github.io/dss-workshops/R/Rintro/images/R_works.png)

## Getting Started [before the session to be completed]

R is a program available on  your computer.
RStudio is a program that allows to visualise outputs from

1. Install the Latest Base Package of R from below:

http://www.r-project.org/

2. Install Rstudio (if comfortable operating + projecting R plots at the command line - omit this step):

https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download


## Getting Help Once Live

1. Ask R for help
?help

2. Understanding packages
?help(package="stats")

3. Using packages
Online tutorials and Google "package documentation""

4. Troubleshooting
Google and use StackOverflow.com


## Basic Calculations

We can operate from the command line like a calculator:

```{r}
5+15
```

A variable is a letter or word that is assigned a value.

```{r,echo=TRUE}
x <- 10
x
y <- 5
y
```

R will automatically add variables of the same type e.g. integers.

```{r,echo=TRUE}

y+x
```

## Basic Concepts

We can combine variables to form a vector:

```{r,echo=TRUE}
z <- c("ER","PR","HR")
z
```

We can search for a particular value in a vector by sequence number:

```{r,echo=TRUE}
z[1]
z[1:3]
z[-1]
```


We can ask if a particular value is in a vector

```{r, echo=TRUE}
z=="PR"
z[z=="PR"]
```

## Data Structures

Most commonly data is brought into R by txt and csv files:

```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/keaan/Documents")
df <- read.csv("data.csv", sep=",",header=T,row.names = 1)
```
Lets take a look at the breast data

```{r,echo=TRUE}
head(df)
```

SO we have a dataframe but exactly is composed of this?

```{r,echo=TRUE}
str(df)
with(df, table(diagnosis))
```

## ML Data Clean-up

Lets eliminate columns where we have missing data.

[along the corridor,up the stairs]

```{r,echo=TRUE}

df <- df[ , colSums(is.na(df)) == 0]

```

We also have to prepare our dataframe as integers for ML.

Firstly, we'll change our factors into a character string.

```{r,echo=TRUE}
df$diagnosis <- as.character(df$diagnosis)
```

Instead of just eliminating useful data, let's create a table that contains these descriptive data.
```{r,echo=TRUE}
pdata <- df[drop=FALSE,, grep("diagnosis", names(df))]
head(pdata)
pdata$label <- df$diagnosis
pdata$diagnosis2 <- pdata$diagnosis
pdata$diagnosis <- ifelse(pdata$diagnosis=="M","Malignant",pdata$diagnosis)
pdata$diagnosis <- ifelse(pdata$diagnosis=="B","Benign",pdata$diagnosis)
head(pdata)
```

And finally, let's prepare our dataframe as integers

```{r,echo=TRUE}
pdata$diagnosis <- ifelse(pdata$diagnosis=="M",1,pdata$diagnosis)
pdata$diagnosis <- ifelse(pdata$diagnosis=="B",0,pdata$diagnosis)
pdata$diagnosis <- as.numeric(pdata$diagnosis)
```

## Install packages - plotting

```{r,echo=TRUE}
# install.packages("ggplot2")
require(ggplot2)
```


## Building our First - Histograms in Base R

- Building graphs in R is like painting a picture.
- Elements are added one layer at a time + built up in levels

Let's see how our data across looks across one variable e..g perimeter mean

```{r,echo=TRUE}
hist(df$perimeter_mean)
hist(df$perimeter_mean,col="purple")
hist(df$perimeter_mean,col="purple",xlab="Perimeter Mean")
hist(df$perimeter_mean,col="purple",xlab="Perimeter Mean",main="Distribution of Perimeter")
```

### How does this compare across both groups?

- As computationally these graphs involve multi-layering which Rknitting does not like - we will move across to Rworksheets.
