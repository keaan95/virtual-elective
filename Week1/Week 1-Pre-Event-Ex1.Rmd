# EXERCISE 1
## 1.1. Add the data file to your ENVIRONMENT.
TIP - Remember to Set your Working Directory to the location of your data file.
  
```{r}
# You can fetch your WORKING directory as follows
getwd()
# Change to your local directory - in my case it is as follows:
setwd("C:/Users/keaan/OneDrive - Newcastle University/HLA - Virtual Elective/Week1/")
df <- read.csv("data.csv")
```
