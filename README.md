# Healthcare Leadership Academy Virtual Elective

Week 1 of our Machine Learning Course in R takes students through the basic functions and calculations of R before introducing students to clinical data to build their first model - a breast cancer classification using histological data. The first week is immersive and highly visual as we introduce a variety of plots to help in the processes of data filtration and feature selection. These are the basic first few steps in building a reliable and robust model. Students keen to push further will also be introduced to a variety of complex computational biology approaches.

## Week 1

### Registration     

Before attending the session on Thursday, ensure you download the RStudio program on your computer by using the links below. This will enable you to make the most out of the session.

Install the [Latest Base Package of R](http://www.r-project.org/) - the raw programming language

Install [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) - the graphical interface to visualise what's happening.

Please let us know in advance if you experience any problems using the links.

### Week 2 Outcomes

Week 2 of our Machine Learning Course in R takes students through the process of building their first breast cancer classification model using histological data. Weâ€™ll step-wise introduce a variety of machine learning algorithms with simplified breakdowns.This week will also highlight best practices for building and evaluating multiple models simultaneously and also introduce even more graphical and data manipulation packages.

      R Advanced - Plotting and Customisation
      ML Introduction - Data Filtration
      ML Introduction  - Model Application
      ML Introduction - Model Evaluation
      ML Introduction - Model Validation
      R Advanced -  Statistical Testing
      R Advanced - Loops and Data Handling

### Week 3 Outcomes

Week 3 of our Machine Learning Course in R takes students through blood results of liver disease and whether these results can reliably split between liver disease and non-diseae patients. What can we further do to improve our results through more aggressive feature selection and optimisation methods.

      ML Introduction - Feature Engineering
      ML Advanced - Further Cross-Validation
      ML Advanced - Further Feature Selection
      ML Advanced - Hyperparameter Optimisation [to be added]
      
### Week 4 Outcomes
Week 4 of our Machine Learning Course in R lets students build their own stepwise model to a clinical problem. Using all the skills learnt above, can they apply it to a dataset and reliably produce their own model. We'll then compare outputs across all students and finally against the outcomes of a paper in modern literature.
